Translation group
=================

Translation group the group that preserves the translation invariance of crystal.
Here we focus on finite translation group (FTG), a homomorphic mapping with the
infinite translation group via periodic boundary conditions. It's often referred
to as a k-point grid or a super cell. We will refer to it as 
:math:`\hat{\mathbf{S}}_{BZ}`.

Reporting Issues
----------------

The command line interfaces of the package, by default, only prints out error messages when an error occurs during execution.
For debugging purposes, the option ``--debug`` or simply ``-D`` can be passed to the CLI to print out the traceback messages to help
locating the error.
Ususally, simple error like syntax error in the input file can be caught with the above messages.

However, one can report complicated issues occurred during usage and development to the developers for further assistance.
Please follow the steps below for report such issues:

#. Make sure the package is up to date: upgrade to the latest version and if the error bug persists,
   try install from ``master`` branch in a virtual environment. Sometimes, if the package is not installed
   in developement mode, the package in python serch path might not be the same version as the package repostory
   on the local machine. One should try:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip uninstall principia-materia && python setup.py install

   to make sure the verions match;

#. Make sure there is no similar issues already reported. If there is, the discussion under those issues might help solving the problem;

#. When reporting the issue, attach the version of the package you are using. This can be found by executing the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python -c "import principia_materia; print(principia_materia.__version__)"

#. Report the exact steps necessary to reproduce the error and describe the expected results. Attach the output of the program or
   screenshots can be helpful.
